My name is Mustafa and I was born on May 17, 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey. I am currently studying in the English preparatory class at Mehmet Emin Saraç Anatolian Imam Hatip High School. From an early age, I have been deeply interested in technology and programming, focusing on both software and hardware development.

I work with C++, Python, and JavaScript, and I’m familiar with web technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. On the hardware side, I enjoy working with Arduino, learning about sensors and basic electronic circuit design.

I consider myself a curious, creative, and detail-oriented person. I like learning new things on my own and turning ideas into real projects. In my free time, I enjoy watching romantic anime and exploring new topics in technology.
